I have never worked with javascript at this level. So it was quite a new experience for me.
It was challenging at first to get used to the syntax and everything. But It is fun. 
I like learning new languages and ways of programming stuff. 
This assignment in particular was a good hands-on introduction for me to javascript (Express js). I loved the fact that everything was explained in a lucid manner
The only thing where I struggled a little was the setup part and figuring out how the routing situation works. I understood routing in lecture but it is one thing to see someone
code and contributing to that code and an entirely different ball game when you have to code yourself.
It is very fun experience.
I have more than 3 years of work experience in java, so , coding in a test driven environment was not something which was new to me.
What was new to me was the use of JEST.
I find the testing situation in this environment quite interesting and quite different from what I have done so far in java.
It is a very different way to write test cases.
Another aspect which I found to be interesting was the use of postman to see the traffic and results over the web.
Overall, I have had a good experience with learning all this stuff through this assignment.
